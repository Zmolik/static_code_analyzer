Learning outcomes:  
–êfter completing this project, I have a good understanding of how static source code analyzers work. I've get more experience with object-oriented programming, regular expressions, file processing. I've got to know the source code representation as the abstract syntax tree. I've learned more about the rules of Python code style.
